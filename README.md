# Methylation-
This document aims to simplify the future processing of bisulfite data in various methylation studies. The main steps in this pipeline are 1) Trim (primer extraction) 2) Maps (mapping of reads to the species reference sequence) 3) Annotation 4) Quantify (quantification of methylation levels at different genome scales).
